# Image and Video Manipulation

## Introduction
This project involves implementing image processing tasks using C++ and OpenCV. The project consists of two main problems, with the third problem requiring a separate project.

## Problem 1: Grayscale and Colored Image Structures
### Objective
Create separate pair of .h and .cpp files for the grayscale and colored image structures, utilizing header guards.

## Problem 2: Structure Modification and Operations
### Objective
Modify the structures for grayscale and colored images to use vectors instead of integer arrays. Adapt all operations on colored and grayscale images using the modified structures.

## Problem 3: Live Video Manipulation
### Objective
Create a program that captures live video from a webcam and displays it in a window. The window should contain three track bars to adjust the pixel values of the three color channels (red, green, blue). The window must display the manipulated video instead of the original one.
